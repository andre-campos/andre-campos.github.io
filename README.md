Responsive resume backed by AngularJS

The point of having a responsive resume online is for it to be viewed in a browser or mobile device. Printing the resume doesn't look that great on some browsers. Twitter Bootstrap isn't famous for producing pixel-perfect pages for printers. Safari actually did a good job for printing the resume, so that's the method I used to generate the PDF that can be downloaded. If you wish to fork this resume, make sure you export a PDF version of your version with Safari.

The printed version brings a QR code pointing to the page for this repository. If you plan on using this, make sure you update that. Otherwise you'll just send a potential employer to me! ;) This resume also uses Google Analytics to track access to my resume. If you'd like to have that with your own, make sure you use your Google account.

Why use Angular to write a resume? Because I can! And considering that I code for a living, it's kind of cool to be able to showcase some of my skills right off the bet with my resume. I've been involved in hiring processes and I never received a cool-looking online resume. As a recruiter, that's something I'd appreciate. In any event, keep in mind it's impossible to please everyone.

The structure of the resume is fairly straight forward. If you don't intend on changing anything on the layout, you can ignore the html file altogether. Go directly to js/resume.js and replace my information with yours. I guess I could make angular load a JSON instead of writing the code directly in Javascript. But it seemed pretty much the same amount of work to me.

If you have any suggestions, questions or criticism, do let me know.
